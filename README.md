# Differential_gene_expression_analysis
Differential Gene Expression Analysis using the airway dataset and DESeq2 in R. This workflow identifies differentially expressed genes between treated and untreated samples (dexamethasone). Key steps include data preprocessing, normalization, model fitting, dispersion estimation, and visualization (MA plot, dispersion plot).


ðŸ§¬**The airway dataset is an RNA-seq dataset that includes gene expression measurements for human airway epithelial cells, with samples from different cell lines and conditions (treated vs untreated with dexamethasone). The analysis involves using DESeq2 to preprocess and normalize the data, estimate dispersion, and perform differential expression testing to identify genes that show significant changes in expression between the treatment groups. Visualization of the results includes MA plots and dispersion plots to assess the quality and significance of the identified genes.**
