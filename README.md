# Differential_gene_expression_analysis
Differential Gene Expression Analysis using the airway dataset and DESeq2 in R. This workflow identifies differentially expressed genes between treated and untreated samples (dexamethasone). Key steps include data preprocessing, normalization, model fitting, dispersion estimation, and visualization (MA plot, dispersion plot).
